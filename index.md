I'm an Associate Professor in Wharton's Department of Statistics and Data Science. I was previously an Associate Professor at Cornell ORIE, an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow, and a PhD student in Math at UCLA under Wotao Yin (Alibaba) and Stefano Soatto (AWS AI). I was a long term visitor at the Simon's Institute in Fall 2017 (bridging discrete and continuous optimization) and Fall 2024 (LLM program). I am currently an associate editor at <a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/10107">Mathematical Programming</a> and <a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/10208">Foundations of Computational Mathematics</a>.

**Research Interests.** Optimization and machine learning.

**Teaching.** I teach theory and practice of optimization and machine learning. I sometimes write lecture notes, e.g., [Optimization in PyTorch](STAT-4830) and [Convex Analysis and First-Order Methods](https://damek.github.io/teaching/orie6300/ORIE6300Fall2023notes.pdf).

**Selected Awards.** I received a <a href="https://sloan.org/fellowships/">Sloan Research Fellowship in Mathematics</a>, an <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2047637">NSF CAREER Award</a>, and the <a href="https://www.siam.org/prizes-recognition/activity-group-prizes/detail/siag-opt-best-paper-prize">SIAM Activity Group on Optimization Best Paper Prize</a>. 

**Selected Works.** Read more about my research [here](research.md). Together with collaborators, I 
- Developed exponential accelerations of <a href="https://x.com/damekdavis/status/1841596498204880924">gradient descent</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/damekdavis/status/1596616542396944384">semismooth Newton</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/damekdavis/status/1682737261727866882?s=20">the subgradient method</a>. 
- Proved first guarantees for SGD on [weakly convex](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06523) and [tame](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07795) functions, which covers essentially all neural networks.
- Characterized the [asymptotic distribution of SGD in nonsmooth optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06632).
- Developed the concept of a strict saddle point in nonsmooth optimization and showed [proximal methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07146) and [stochastic subgradient methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11832) avoid them.
- Developed [kernel methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08277) that efficiently learn sparse hierarchical functions.


**Students.** I've advised 5 PhD students. If you are a Penn student and wish to discuss advising/collaboration, send me a concise, informative email to set up a meeting. I am an active advisor--students who work best with me tend to have energy levels that match or exceed mine.

**You may not know that...** 
- I started [programming](https://x.com/damekdavis/status/1627803139830317056) in html in '98. I made a Pokémon website.
- I took up guitar In '99, played in bands, wrote and recorded music regularly into college. 
    - I played banjo from 2010-2012, mainly in clawhammer style.
    - I mostly play piano, now. I like to sing and sight read chord charts off of ultimate guitar.
- I worked throughout highschool, cleaning tables, bagging groceries, and making coffees. 
- In 2006, I applied to one college, UC Irvine. 
    - I could only afford one application fee and it was close to the beach.
    - I intended to study music and lived in the arts dorm. 
    - I took calculus my first semester and realized I loved math.
    - I took [algebra](https://www.math.uci.edu/~dwan/230-08) with [Daqing Wan](https://www.math.uci.edu/~dwan/) in 2009; we worked on a [commutative algebra problem](http://www.ams.org/journals/proc/2011-139-03/S0002-9939-2010-10620-2/).
- I went to grad school at UCLA for pure math in 2010. I loved [Algebra](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4613-0041-0).
    - I learned ML was a thing in 2012 and took [learning from data](https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse) with set-theorist Bill Chen. 
    - I got excited about AI and joined [UCLA's vision lab](http://vision.ucla.edu/people.html) in 2012.
    - A year in, I saw optimization was everywhere. I just understood nothing about it.
    - I read [Nesterov's book](https://www.amazon.com/Introductory-Lectures-Convex-Optimization-Applied/dp/1402075537) in 2013. I tried to prove each theorem before reading the proof.
    - I took Wotao's course in F' 2013, and [solved an open problem](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-41589-5_4) he mentioned in class.
    - Without Wotao's encouragement, I would not have applied to faculty jobs in 2014.
- I became interested in writing in 2016.
    - Two books influenced me: [Clear and Simple as the Truth](https://www.amazon.com/Clear-Simple-Truth-Writing-Princeton/dp/0691602999) and [Style](https://www.amazon.com/Style-Lessons-Clarity-Grace-12th/dp/0134080416/).
        - The first helped me appreciate writing.
        - The second taught me how to structure text so a busy reader could appreciate it.
    - I think writing improves when you become more comfortable with rejection.
    - I decided to do more writing in public in 2025.
        - In the spring semester, I wrote [course notes for optimization in PyTorch](http://optimizationinpytorch.com).
        - In May, I started writing [notes](random) on what I've been thinking about.
        - In July, I began [learning LLMs from scratch](https://x.com/damekdavis/status/1937275870663598216) from an [engineering perspective](https://x.com/damekdavis/status/1949507725626347825).
- [Minerva](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14858) convinced me LLMs could eventually accelerate mathematics research. Since then,
    - I've spoken to LLMs more than anyone else I know, for math, coding, writing, and even negotiating medical bills.
    - I've used LLMs to help me [almost formalize](https://github.com/damek/gd-lean) convergence of gradient descent in [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/). 
        - As of April 2025, no LLM could complete the proof.
    - I was [awarded a grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2523384&HistoricalAwards=false) on that aims to use AI techniques to solve the [Hadamard conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_matrix#Hadamard_conjecture).
